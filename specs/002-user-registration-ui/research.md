# Research for User Registration Feature

## Testing Frameworks

### Decision: Backend Testing Framework
**Chosen**: JUnit 5 and Mockito
**Rationale**: JUnit 5 is the standard testing framework for Java applications, and Mockito is widely used for mocking dependencies in unit tests, which is essential for Spring Boot applications.
**Alternatives considered**: TestNG (less common in Spring Boot projects).

### Decision: Frontend Testing Framework
**Chosen**: Jest and React Testing Library
**Rationale**: Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework, and React Testing Library provides utilities for testing React components in a user-centric way, ensuring accessibility and maintainability.
**Alternatives considered**: Enzyme (older, less focused on user behavior).

## Scale and Scope Assumptions

### Decision: Expected User Count
**Chosen**: Up to 100,000 registered users.
**Rationale**: This provides a reasonable target for initial infrastructure sizing and performance testing without over-engineering for extreme scale prematurely.
**Alternatives considered**: 1,000 users (too small for a typical application), 1,000,000+ users (requires more complex distributed architecture, not in scope for initial feature).

### Decision: Data Volume for User Credentials
**Chosen**: User table size up to 100,000 records, with average record size ~1KB.
**Rationale**: Directly correlates with the expected user count, providing a concrete metric for database sizing and performance considerations.
**Alternatives considered**: Smaller or larger volumes without clear justification.
