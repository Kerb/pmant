# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The user registration feature will allow new users to create an account by providing a unique login and a password (minimum 8 characters). The registration form will be visually centered and responsive. Upon successful registration, the user will be automatically logged in. Passwords will be securely stored using BCrypt with a randomly generated salt, and all registration data transmission will use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Empty login or password fields will be rejected with appropriate error messages. The backend will be implemented with Java 17 and Spring Boot, and the frontend with React (JavaScript/TypeScript).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Java 17 (Backend), JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot (Backend), React (Frontend)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL  
**Testing**: Backend: JUnit 5 and Mockito; Frontend: Jest and React Testing Library (Unit/Integration), Cypress/Playwright (E2E)  
**Target Platform**: Docker containers on a Linux-compatible host
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend + database)  
**Performance Goals**: 95% of new users can successfully complete the registration process within 30 seconds.  
**Constraints**: Minimum password length of 8 characters; HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher for data transmission; prevent empty login/password.  
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 100,000 registered users; User table size up to 100,000 records, with average record size ~1KB.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Component Isolation**: Consistent. All components will run in isolated Docker containers.
- **II. Backend Technology Stack**: Consistent. Java 17 and Spring Boot will be used for the backend.
- **III. Frontend Technology Stack**: Consistent. React will be used for the frontend.
- **IV. Database**: Consistent. PostgreSQL will be used as the dedicated database component.
- **V. Local Development Environment**: Consistent. `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` are present for local development.
- **VI. Backend Project Structure and Build Tool**: Consistent. Backend code in `backend-app` and Maven as the build tool.
- **VII. Frontend Project Structure**: Consistent. Frontend code in `frontend-app`.
- **VIII. Database Configuration**: Consistent. Database container named `db`, running PostgreSQL from Docker.
- **IX. Frontend Proxy and Routing**: Consistent. Nginx will be configured to proxy requests to frontend and backend.
- **X. Database Access and Migrations**: Not explicitly detailed in spec, but will adhere to constitution: jOOQ for database access and Liquibase for migrations. No violations.

**Structure Decision**: 

backend-app directory contains maven standard layout for backend code
frontend-app directory contains react standard layout for frontend code


## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
