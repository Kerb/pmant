# Implementation Plan: Minimal Docker Compose Application

**Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: /Users/kerba/Documents/pmant/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

As a developer, I want to launch a minimal application using Docker Compose, consisting of a frontend (`index.html` with a "ping" button) and a backend, to verify inter-service communication. The application will be containerized using Docker Compose, with a Java 17/Spring Boot backend, a React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database. Nginx will act as a frontend proxy. The frontend will display "Loading..." during backend requests, and the backend will log requests using SLF4J/Logback.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Java 17 (Backend), JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend - React)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot (Backend), React (Frontend), Docker Compose (Orchestration), Nginx (Proxy), PostgreSQL (Database), SLF4J/Logback (Backend Logging)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL  
**Testing**: Unit and integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Docker containers on a Linux-compatible host
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend + database)  
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response time for single user  
**Constraints**: No specific constraints beyond minimal functionality  
**Scale/Scope**: Minimal application for demonstrating inter-service communication

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Component Isolation:** Pass. The feature explicitly uses Docker Compose for isolated containers.
- **II. Backend Technology Stack:** Pass. The plan aligns with Java 17 and Spring Boot.
- **III. Frontend Technology Stack:** Pass. The plan aligns with React.
- **IV. Database:** Pass. The plan aligns with PostgreSQL.
- **V. Local Development Environment:** Pass. The feature explicitly requires `docker-compose.yml`. `docker-compose.override.yml` will be part of the implementation.
- **VI. Backend Project Structure and Build Tool:** Pass. The plan aligns with `backend-app` folder and Maven.
- **VII. Frontend Project Structure:** Pass. The plan aligns with `frontend-app` folder.
- **VIII. Database Configuration:** Pass. The plan aligns with `db` container name and PostgreSQL.
- **IX. Frontend Proxy and Routing:** Pass. The plan aligns with Nginx as a frontend proxy.

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a web application structure with `backend-app` for the Java/Spring Boot backend, `frontend-app` for the React frontend, `nginx` for the Nginx proxy configuration, and `db` for database-related files. `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` will be at the root.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
