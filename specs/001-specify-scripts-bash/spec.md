# Feature Specification: Minimal Docker Compose Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash`  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Я, как разработчик, хочу запустить минимальное приложение из docker compose, например, это может быть минимальная страница index.html с одной кнопкой \"ping\" при нажатии на которую запрос отправляется в backend"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Launch Minimal Application (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to launch the minimal application using Docker Compose so that I can quickly see the frontend and backend services running.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality and the first step for any developer.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `docker-compose up` and verifying that all services start without errors and are accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docker and Docker Compose are installed, **When** I execute `docker-compose up`, **Then** the frontend, backend, and database services start successfully.
2. **Given** the services are running, **When** I navigate to the frontend URL in a web browser, **Then** I see the `index.html` page with a "ping" button.

### User Story 2 - Ping Backend from Frontend (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to click the "ping" button on the frontend so that a request is sent to the backend and I receive a response, verifying inter-service communication.

**Why this priority**: This verifies the core interaction between frontend and backend, which is crucial for a functional application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by interacting with the frontend in a browser and observing the network requests and responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the minimal application is running and the `index.html` page is displayed, **When** I click the "ping" button, **Then** an HTTP request is sent to the backend.
2. **Given** the request is sent to the backend, **When** the backend processes the request, **Then** the frontend displays a "pong" message or similar success indicator.
3. **Given** the "ping" button is clicked, **When** the frontend is waiting for a response from the backend, **Then** the frontend displays "Loading..." text.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the backend service is not running when the "ping" button is clicked? The frontend should display an error message.
- How does the system handle network issues between frontend and backend? The frontend should display a connection error.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and orchestrate the application services (frontend, backend, database).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST include a minimal `index.html` file for the frontend.
- **FR-003**: The `index.html` file MUST contain a button labeled "ping".
- **FR-004**: Clicking the "ping" button MUST send an HTTP request to the backend service.
- **FR-005**: The backend service MUST respond to the "ping" request with a predefined success message.
- **FR-006**: The frontend MUST display the response from the backend.
- **FR-007**: The frontend MUST display an error message if the backend is unreachable or returns an error.
- **FR-008**: The frontend MUST display "Loading..." text while waiting for a response from the backend after a "ping" request.
- **FR-009**: The backend application MUST use SLF4J and Logback for logging, configured with a console appender.

### Key Entities

- **Frontend Application**: Serves `index.html` and sends requests.
- **Backend Application**: Receives requests and sends responses.
- **Database**: (Implicitly part of the Docker Compose setup, but not directly interacted with by this feature).

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A developer can successfully launch the entire application stack (frontend, backend, database) using a single `docker-compose up` command.
- **SC-002**: A developer can access the frontend `index.html` page in a web browser.
- **SC-003**: Clicking the "ping" button on the frontend successfully triggers a backend response, and the response is displayed on the frontend.
- **SC-004**: The application demonstrates basic inter-service communication between frontend and backend.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-18
- Q: What should the frontend display while waiting for a backend response after clicking "ping"? → A: A simple "Loading..." text.
- Q: Should the backend log incoming "ping" requests to the console? → A: Use slf4j and logback for backend app logging, configure just console appender for now.
- Q: Were any specific frontend frameworks or backend technologies considered and rejected for this minimal setup? → A: No - For this minimal setup, the chosen technologies (React, Spring Boot) are standard and no specific alternatives were explicitly rejected.
